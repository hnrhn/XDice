**= XDice v3.2.3 - [Forbidden Lands Edition] =**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_XDice - Forbidden Lands Edition_ listens for the following activation phrases:

**Forbidden Lands Roll**
`/r BASE SKILL GEAR [ARTIFACT]`
    - BASE, SKILL, and GEAR are mandatory. If you wish to roll 0, you must enter that as a value.
    - ARTIFACT is optional, and can be one of the following options:
        - `m` or `8` or `d8`
        - `e` or `10` or `d10`
        - `l` or `12` or `d12`
    If ARTIFACT is excluded or is anything other than the above options, it defaults to 0
Example: `/r 3 0 2` - Rolls 3 Base dice, 0 Skill dice, 2 Gear dice, and 0 Artifact dice.
Example: `/r 1 2 3 l` - Rolls 1 Base die, 2 Skill dice, 3 Gear dice, and a Legendary artifact die (d12)

**Push**
`/push`
Re-rolls any dice from your previous roll which were not :crossed_swords: or :skull: and outputs the new total roll.

**Pride**
`/pride`
Works like **Push**, but also adds your Pride die (d12) to the new roll

**Initiative Deck**
`/newdeck`
Creates and shuffles a new deck of ten Initiative cards numbered 1-10.
`/draw`
Draw one of the cards from the Initiative Deck.

**Other dice types**
To roll dice outside of the Forbidden Lands format, use the template XdY
Example: `/r 5d20` - this will roll 5 d20s
`/coin`
Output either Heads or Tails

`/help`
Output this message again.
