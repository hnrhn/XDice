Nice!

Our next configuration step is multiple-choice. XDice can handle inputs like **XdY + Z**. What we're going to set up now is what she should do with that **+ Z** part. Here are your options:

1) Nothing. Ignore it entirely!
~~2) Add Z on to the total of your rolls. e.g. `/roll 2d10 + 5 -> [10, 10] = 25`~~
3) Add an automatic success. For instance: `/roll 1d10 + 1 -> [10] = 2 Successes`

To choose, send a message
`/xdice config plus_behaviour 1`
or
~~`/xdice config plus_behaviour 2`~~
or
`/xdice config plus_behaviour 3`

Up to you, boss!
