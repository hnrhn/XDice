Our next step seems dangerous. "Exploding Dice"! In some systems, when you roll a certain number, the die can "explode" into copies of itself! XDice likes this one. She can handle that in _four_ different ways:

1) No explosions. The gunpowder will be removed from all dice post-haste!
~~2) Double success. XDice will add an extra success for every explosion, no questions asked~~
3) Roll again. Every exploding die magically clones itself and rolls again. The copies can't explode, so on the second roll, what you get is what you get.
4) Roll again, with exploding copies. Potentially infinite explosions! Exploding dice create copies, and those copies can explode too.

Your magic incantation for choosing the right level of explosions for your game is `/xdice config explode_behaviour 1` (or 2 or 3 or 4!)

So what's it gonna be?
