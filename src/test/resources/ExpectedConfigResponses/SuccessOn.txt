Excellent! Of course, to count Successes, XDice needs to know what your game considers a success to be, so let's configure that now.

Send a message like this: `/xdice config success_on 10 9 8 1`.
In this example, 8s, 9s, 10s, and..... 1s for some reason, will all count as Successes!

This step is a little tricky for poor XDice, so make sure you include every number you want to consider as a success, with **one** space between them.
