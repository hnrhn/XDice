All done! Above is the output of the `/xdice help` command, which gives you a complete overview of the settings you have enabled on your server.

Look over it, and if you're happy with everything, send the message `/xdice config confirm`, and you'll be ready to play! If not, send `/xdice config cancel` to shut me down and exit Configuration Mode so you can start over.

And remember, if you ever need this help information again, just send XDice the message `/xdice help`.

Are you happy with this configuration?
`/xdice config confirm` to save and exit configuration mode.
or
`/xdice config cancel` to discard all changes and exit configuration mode.
