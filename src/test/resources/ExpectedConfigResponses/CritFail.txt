We're getting close to the end now, just one more configuration to set up!
In many Success-based systems, rolling 1s without any successes is a Critical Failure. Do you want XDice to let you know when that happens? It'll look something like this:
**[3,2,1,1] = Critical Fail**

`/xdice config crit_fail_behaviour yes`
or
`/xdice config crit_fail_behaviour no`.

One last time, tell me what you need!
