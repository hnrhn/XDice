Hi! I'm the XDice configuration assistant!
I'm going to guide you through the process of setting up XDice for your game.

I've been told that humans feel more at ease when their assistants have names, so you can call me `ConfigurationAssistant_Instance_#0000`, or **Confi** for short.

Alright! Now that we've gotten to know each other a little better, let's get on with the configuration, so you can get back to playing your games.

First, I need to know how many sides are on the most common die you and your fellow players will be rolling.

For example, if you are playing _Dungeons & Dragons_, you will be rolling a lot of d20s, so I will make that the default die.
That way, when you want to roll a d20, you won't need to say so; XDice will know automatically! Isn't she wonderful?

So, to set the default for your game, send a message like so:
`/xdice config default_dice X` with X being the number of sides on your favourite dice.

For example, if you will roll mostly d20s, the command is:
`/xdice config default_dice 20`.

Ready when you are!
