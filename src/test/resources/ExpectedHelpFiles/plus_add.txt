**= XDice v3.2.0=**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**BASIC USAGE**
XDice listens for messages beginning with one of the activation phrases
`/roll` or `!roll`
then a "dice request" in this format:
`XdY + Z`
Therefore a full "roll command" looks something like this:
`/roll 3d12 + 5`
or
`!roll 3d12 + 5`

There is also a special roll command for randomly generating Rock/Paper/Scissors results:
`/rps` or `!rps`
and another special command for flipping a coin:
`/coin`
SPLIT
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**SHORTCUTS**
Not every part of the roll command is required. XDice on your server has been configured with default values for X, Y, and Z to help you type less:
```
X = 1
Y = 101
Z = 0
```
Spaces between the X, Y, and Z elements are optional, as are the letters **oll** in the word "roll".
i.e. `!r` and `/r` work exactly the same as `!roll` and `/roll`

So for example, in this server `/r5` will roll 5d101s, `!r d8` will roll 1d8.
The smallest possible roll command is just two characters long:
`/r` or `!r` -> This will roll 1d101.

For your server, the number specified in the `Z` position will add the value of Z to the total of your rolled dice
